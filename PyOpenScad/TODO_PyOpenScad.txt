-- Add **kwargs to all SCAD objects so all Python-rendered SCAD functions accept
    extra unspecified arguments, since OpenSCAD has this behavior.
-- Unit testing.
-- Comprehensive docs
-- Applescript or other inter-app communication that will recompile in OpenSCAD
    whenever requested via your Python code
-- Debugging info?  This isn't really present for SCAD, so it's hard from Python.
-- Programmatic way to designate parameters users might want to change
-- Gui for setting parameters - sliders, dropdowns, etc.  Well... that's a separate project.

Completed:
-- Add handling for the #*!% SCAD characters (debug, disable, root, background) -ETJ 15 Feb 2011
-- Improving syntax so it's as close as possible to OpenSCAD's -ETJ 15 Feb 2011
